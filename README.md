# AutoCadPlot
This software is useful when you want to print multiple drawings at once.
The drawings must be in one line with exactly the same spacing between, and they must all be the same length.
All you have to do is do the following:
-	Enter the coordinates of the upper left corner of the first drawing and enter the  coordinates of the lower right corner of the last drawing.
-	Enter a length of one drawing ("Drawing Length") with a precision of 0.0000
- Enter path of output folder in which you want to print drawings
- Clicking "Save As Default" you will save these entries so you no longer have to enter them
-	Select other plot options and click OK   
After clicking „OK“, all you need to do to start printing your drawings is as follows:
-	Type "script" in AutoCad file and browse for AutoCad Plot.scr file which is located in the same folder as program AutoCadPlot.
Printing should have started!
